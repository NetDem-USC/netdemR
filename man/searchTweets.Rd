returns tweets created before this date. Date should be formatted as 
YYYY-MM-DD. Keep in mind that the search index has a 7-day limit}

receive: "recent" (default), "popular" or "mixed".}

\item{lang}{restricts tweets to the given language (e.g. "es")}

\description{
\code{searchTweets} connects to the REST API of Twitter and returns 
recent tweets (usually no more than 5-7 days old) based on a supplied
search string. Note that this function will not return all tweets. As
explained in the documentation (\url{https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/search}),
the goal of this API endpoint is relevance and not completeness.
